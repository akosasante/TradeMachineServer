He has never been particularly good at making contact, and thankfully has walked 10.8 percent of the time during his major league career, the only thing that keeps him on the radar in points-based leagues. Fortunately, Moncada is still only 23 years old, so it's possible he could show improvement as he matures. He's a lot less likely today to reach his predicted top-five-second-baseman ceiling than he was a year or two ago, though, and those selecting him in the middle rounds need be prepared for the batting average hit.

2018 wasn't only indisputably the best among fantasy closers; it was a truly historic campaign among finishers. His 57 saves tied for second-most in a season all time, he became only the seventh pitcher in history with at least 40 saves, a sub-2.0 ERA and a sub-0.80 WHIP season on his r�sum�, and his 44.3 percent strikeout rate was seventh in history by a pitcher with at least 50 innings pitched. Better yet: Diaz converted 27 of 28 save chances with a 1.15 ERA, 0.64 WHIP and 47.9 percent K rate in the Seattle Mariners' final 81 games of 2018, at a time when most might've assumed he'd be more likely to fade after having made 41 appearances in the team's first 81 games. He's bound to regress, as any pitcher coming off a historically excellent season would, and his hefty workload could be a slight issue, but Diaz also gained slightly by the league switch with his winter trade to the New York Mets.

a persistent bout with shoulder inflammation during the second half of last season served as an obstacle to Sale challenging for the honor of No. 1 pitcher in fantasy, and that he managed to finish 18th on the Player Rater and 12th in terms of fantasy points despite pitching only 158 innings is a testament to his otherworldly skills. He managed at least a 30 percent strikeout rate for the fourth time, his walk rate was under 6 percent for a sixth consecutive season, and he surrendered hard contact (per Statcast) on only 27 percent of his balls in play, fourth best among pitchers with at least 25 starts. In short, Sale showed little to no sign of loss of skill due to the ailment, with a roughly 1.5 mph drop in average fastball velocity being the most noticeable effect. That does make him a pitcher more worth tracking, health-wise, during spring training than the others ranked in his range, but it's not enough to drop him from the top three among starters in any fantasy format.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":16.887096774193548,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":-31.0,"34":292.5,"37":-74.5,"39":-20.5,"45":-56.0,"46":-20.0,"48":260.0,"53":17.0,"54":-5.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":130.0},"appliedTotal":523.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":585.0,"35":769.0,"36":0.0,"37":149.0,"38":0.209859155,"39":41.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.974358974,"42":14.0,"43":0.265279584,"44":60.0,"45":56.0,"46":20.0,"47":2.584615384,"48":260.0,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":17.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.772727273,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":26.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":6.341463415,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":13.32,"appliedStats":{"32":25.0,"33":-25.0,"34":221.0,"37":-61.5,"39":-18.5,"76":10.0,"45":-72.0,"46":-24.0,"48":218.0,"53":6.0,"54":-11.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":65.0},"appliedTotal":333.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":25.0,"33":25.0,"34":442.0,"35":612.0,"36":2466.0,"37":123.0,"38":0.22122302,"39":37.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.08597285,"42":13.0,"43":0.28267974,"44":80.0,"45":72.0,"46":24.0,"47":4.39819005,"48":218.0,"49":13.31674208,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":6.0,"54":11.0,"55":0.35294118,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":1.0,"63":13.0,"64":1.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":10.0,"77":15.0,"78":4.0,"79":2.0,"80":0.0,"82":5.89189189,"99":1.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":31,"totalRanking":84,"totalRating":333.0},"1":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0},"2":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093334,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":32116,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":32116,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":5,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":2,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":9,"published":false,"rank":110,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Miles","fullName":"Miles Mikolas","gamesPlayedByPosition":{"1":32},"id":32116,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Mikolas","lastNewsDate":1571173049000,"lastVideoDate":1563249273000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":0.0,"percentChange":0.1288042157672038,"percentOwned":74.63983535330436,"percentStarted":57.481515359402394},"proTeamId":24,"seasonOutlook":"Mikolas spent three years in Japan, during which time he had a 2.18 ERA and 5.48 strikeout-to-walk ratio and completely retooled his game, and kept all of his overseas gains upon his return to the States in 2018. He maintained the 94 mph fastball he had in his previous big-league stint, but brought his outstanding slider back with him, a pitch that limited opponents to .184/.212/.245 triple-slash rates with the St. Louis Cardinals. Unfortunately, despite that pitch, Mikolas couldn't get many swings and misses, his 18.1 percent strikeout rate seventh-lowest among 58 ERA qualifiers. He'll need to improve that in order to repeat last season's top-15 fantasy starter finishes (regardless of format), although he's a polished enough pitcher with his recent tweaks to at least challenge for the position's top 30.

one in the game strikes the baseball with more authority than Judge: He has now led the majors in both average exit velocity (per Statcast) as well as hard-contact rate in each of the past two seasons. That's with lowering the bar for qualification last season, however, as he missed 45 team games due to a broken right wrist suffered when he was hit by a Jakob Junis pitch July 26, which was really the only obstacle in his path to an outstanding repeat of his monstrous 2017 rookie campaign outside of natural regression. Asking Judge to repeat 52 home runs was a tall task, and fantasy managers will be smarter with their expectations this time. What they shouldn't overlook when considering his rebound prospects: He improved slightly in terms of his plate discipline, chasing non-strikes nearly 2 percent less often, and he added 69 points of wOBA to his performance against breaking balls (curveballs and sliders) while missing against them more than 2 percent less often. Judge made key adjustments last season, and it's not unthinkable the 2017 version is the one who takes the field in 2019. But even if we split the difference and prorate the stats to a 162-game schedule, he's going to be one of the 25 best assets in rotisserie scoring, and only slightly less valuable than that in points-based leagues (primarily due to his likelihood of striking out 200 times).","stats":[{"appliedAverage":2.860869565217391,"appliedStats":{"0":-41.0,"1":20.0,"3":6.0,"4":3.0,"5":27.0,"7":2.1,"10":11.200000000000001,"76":0.0,"12":0.8,"20":30.0,"21":19.5,"23":0.0,"24":-1.0,"26":-1.6,"27":-10.2},"appliedTotal":65.8,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":82.0,"1":20.0,"2":0.24390244,"3":3.0,"4":1.0,"5":9.0,"6":13.0,"7":7.0,"8":52.0,"9":0.63414634,"10":14.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":97.0,"17":0.36082474,"18":0.99497108,"19":18.41666667,"20":20.0,"21":13.0,"22":3.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":2.0,"27":34.0,"28":415.0,"29":4.27835052,"31":0.0,"67":40.0,"68":38.0,"69":2.0,"70":2.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":13.0,"75":10.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":23.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.7317241379310344,"appliedStats":{"0":-260.5,"1":145.0,"3":52.0,"4":3.0,"5":117.0,"7":23.7,"10":82.4,"76":0.0,"12":4.0,"15":0.0,"20":154.5,"21":136.5,"23":12.0,"24":-4.0,"26":-10.4,"27":-59.099999999999994,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"37":0.0,"39":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":396.09999999999997,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":521.0,"1":145.0,"2":0.27831094,"3":26.0,"4":1.0,"5":39.0,"6":66.0,"7":79.0,"8":290.0,"9":0.556621881,"10":103.0,"11":6.0,"12":5.0,"13":5.0,"14":5.0,"15":0.0,"16":634.0,"17":0.399053628,"18":0.955675509,"19":0.0,"20":103.0,"21":91.0,"22":0.0,"23":8.0,"24":4.0,"25":4.0,"26":13.0,"27":197.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":145.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.5700000000000003,"appliedStats":{"0":-18.0,"1":10.0,"3":4.0,"4":3.0,"5":15.0,"7":0.6,"10":4.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.8,"20":13.5,"21":9.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-5.3999999999999995},"appliedTotal":35.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":36.0,"1":10.0,"2":0.27777778,"3":2.0,"4":1.0,"5":5.0,"6":8.0,"7":2.0,"8":29.0,"9":0.80555556,"10":5.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":42.0,"17":0.38095238,"18":1.18650794,"19":10.6097561,"20":9.0,"21":6.0,"22":1.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":18.0,"28":176.0,"29":4.19047619,"31":0.0,"67":14.0,"68":13.0,"69":1.0,"70":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":3.0,"75":7.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":10.0}},{"appliedAverage":1.0999999999999999,"appliedStats":{"0":-7.0,"1":3.0,"3":0.0,"4":3.0,"5":3.0,"7":0.3,"10":0.8,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"20":3.0,"21":1.5,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-2.4},"appliedTotal":4.3999999999999995,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":14.0,"1":3.0,"2":0.21428571,"3":0.0,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":2.0,"7":1.0,"8":8.0,"9":0.57142857,"10":1.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":15.0,"17":0.26666667,"18":0.83809524,"19":2.13333333,"20":2.0,"21":1.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":8.0,"28":67.0,"29":4.46666667,"31":0.0,"67":7.0,"68":6.0,"69":1.0,"70":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":4.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.466666666666667,"appliedStats":{"0":-189.0,"1":103.0,"3":36.0,"4":3.0,"5":81.0,"7":17.099999999999998,"10":51.2,"76":0.0,"12":2.4000000000000004,"15":0.5,"20":112.5,"21":82.5,"23":4.5,"24":-2.0,"26":-8.8,"27":-42.3},"appliedTotal":251.6,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":378.0,"1":103.0,"2":0.27248677,"3":18.0,"4":1.0,"5":27.0,"6":46.0,"7":57.0,"8":204.0,"9":0.53968254,"10":64.0,"11":4.0,"12":3.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":447.0,"17":0.38116592,"18":0.92084846,"19":77.07692308,"20":75.0,"21":55.0,"22":12.0,"23":3.0,"24":2.0,"25":1.0,"26":11.0,"27":141.0,"28":1927.0,"29":4.3206278,"31":0.0,"67":184.0,"68":177.0,"69":7.0,"70":7.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":61.0,"75":41.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":102.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":12,"totalRanking":190,"totalRating":251.6},"1":{"positionalRanking":30,"totalRanking":574,"totalRating":4.4000006},"2":{"positionalRanking":7,"totalRanking":62,"totalRating":35.699997},"3":{"positionalRanking":7,"totalRanking":67,"totalRating":65.799995}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":15,"pendingTransaction

2018 was a season for the ages: He whiffed a major-league-leading 46.7 percent of the batters he faced, the fourth-best rate by any pitcher with at least 50 innings pitched in a single season in history, and he had 18 appearances of at least two innings pitched without allowing a run, the most by any pitcher in six years. Such a performance will be practically impossible to repeat, especially since he pitched a combined 91 1/3 innings in the regular season and postseason and therefore could be at risk of fatigue. However, if he's able to at all lower his 9.8 percent walk rate, he could run away with the Milwaukee Brewers' closer role and be the unquestioned No. 1 reliever in fantasy. As is, Hader finished fifth on the Player Rater and in fantasy points among all relief pitchers in 2018, despite only 12 saves. His value will be greatest in leagues that allow daily transactions, as he can be slotted in around your starters while maximizing his amazing ratios.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.785714285714286,"appliedStats":{"32":14.0,"33":0.0,"34":24.0,"37":-3.5,"39":-1.5,"76":13.0,"45":-3.0,"46":-2.0,"48":29.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"57":11.0,"58":-1.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":81.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":14.0,"33":0.0,"34":48.0,"35":58.0,"36":224.0,"37":7.0,"38":0.12962963,"39":3.0,"40":1.0,"41":0.625,"42":1.0,"43":0.18965517,"44":3.0,"45":3.0,"46":2.0,"47":1.6875,"48":29.0,"49":16.3125,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"55":1.0,"56":12.0,"57":11.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.91666667,"60":0.0,"61":3.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":13.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":9.66666667,"83":11.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.368421052631579,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":57.0,"33":0.0,"34":123.0,"37":-25.0,"39":-18.0,"45":-20.0,"46":-8.0,"48":124.0,"53":4.0,"54":-5.0,"57":9.0,"58":-3.0,"60":11.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":249.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":57.0,"33":0.0,"34":246.0,"35":320.0,"36":0.0,"37":50.0,"38":0.178571429,"39":36.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.048780488,"42":3.0,"43":0.278125,"44":21.0,"45":20.0,"46":8.0,"47":2.195121951,"48":124.0,"50":0.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.444444444,"56":12.0,"57":9.0,"58":3.0,"59":0.75,"60":22.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.444444444,"83":31.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.5,"appliedStats":{"32":6.0,"33":0.0,"34":10.0,"37":-3.0,"39":-1.0,"76":5.0,"45":-3.0,"46":-2.0,"48":11.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":5.0,"58":-1.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":27.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":6.0,"33":0.0,"34":20.0,"35":28.0,"36":106.0,"37":6.0,"38":0.24,"39":2.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.2,"42":1.0,"43":0.32142857,"44":3.0,"45":3.0,"46":2.0,"47":4.05,"48":11.0,"49":14.85,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":6.0,"57":5.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.83333333,"60":0.0,"61":2.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":5.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":5.5,"83":5.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.8333333333333335,"appliedStats":{"32":3.0,"33":0.0,"34":5.0,"37":-2.0,"39":-0.5,"76":2.0,"45":-1.0,"46":-1.0,"48":5.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":2.0,"58":-1.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":11.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":3.0,"33":0.0,"34":10.0,"35":16.0,"36":48.0,"37":4.0,"38":0.28571429,"39":1.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.5,"42":1.0,"43":0.375,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":2.7,"48":5.0,"49":13.5,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":3.0,"57":2.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.66666667,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":5.0,"83":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.360655737704918,"appliedStats":{"32":61.0,"33":0.0,"34":113.5,"37":-20.5,"39":-10.0,"76":51.0,"45":-22.0,"46":-15.0,"48":138.0,"53":3.0,"54":-5.0,"57":37.0,"58":-7.0,"60":3.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":327.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":61.0,"33":0.0,"34":227.0,"35":289.0,"36":1181.0,"37":41.0,"38":0.15471698,"39":20.0,"40":2.0,"41":0.8061674,"42":4.0,"43":0.22491349,"44":24.0,"45":22.0,"46":15.0,"47":2.61674009,"48":138.0,"49":16.41409692,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":3.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.375,"56":44.0,"57":37.0,"58":7.0,"59":0.84090909,"60":6.0,"61":8.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":51.0,"77":10.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":6.9,"83":43.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":1,"totalRanking":89,"totalRating":327.0},"1":{"positionalRanking":50,"totalRanking":208,"totalRating":11.5},"2":{"positionalRanking":20,"totalRanking":146,"totalRating":27.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":1,"totalRanking":29,"totalRating":81.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":9,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":34986,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":34986,"kee

breakthrough never occurred for the talented Benintendi in Year 2, despite the fact that he improved from roughly a top-60 overall finish in terms of the Player Rater and total fantasy points in 2017 to approximately top-30 in 2018. Benintendi continued to fill every primary rotisserie category without excelling in any one individually. Of most concern: He batted .279/.343/.384 in 57 games after the All-Star break, hitting the ball on the ground 46.5 percent of the time while making hard contact at only a 31.3 percent rate, suggesting further adjustments are required before he truly excels. Benintendi's pro-career scouting reports suggest he could be a five-category star in a short time, and in dynasty/keeper leagues he's worth more of an investment, perhaps a top-20 selection overall. In redraft formats, however, he's not quite building-block material � at least not unless you're feeling particularly lucky about a quick skills turnaround or see something tangible from him in spring games.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":0.42272727272727284,"appliedStats":{"0":-33.5,"1":10.0,"3":4.0,"4":0.0,"5":3.0,"7":2.1,"10":6.4,"76":0.0,"12":0.8,"15":1.0,"20":13.5,"21":6.0,"23":1.5,"24":0.0,"26":-1.6,"27":-3.9},"appliedTotal":9.300000000000002,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":67.0,"1":10.0,"2":0.14925373,"3":2.0,"4":0.0,"5":1.0,"6":3.0,"7":7.0,"8":15.0,"9":0.2238806,"10":8.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":2.0,"16":78.0,"17":0.24675325,"18":0.47063384,"19":3.6,"20":9.0,"21":4.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":2.0,"27":13.0,"28":301.0,"29":3.85897436,"31":0.0,"67":24.0,"68":23.0,"69":1.0,"70":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":10.0,"75":12.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":22.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.391503267973856,"appliedStats":{"0":-291.5,"1":167.0,"3":78.0,"4":18.0,"5":51.0,"7":31.5,"10":55.2,"76":0.0,"12":3.2,"15":1.0,"20":141.0,"21":129.0,"23":30.0,"24":-5.0,"26":-10.4,"27":-32.1,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"37":0.0,"39":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":365.9,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":583.0,"1":167.0,"2":0.2864494,"3":39.0,"4":6.0,"5":17.0,"6":62.0,"7":105.0,"8":269.0,"9":0.461406518,"10":69.0,"11":3.0,"12":4.0,"13":6.0,"14":8.0,"15":2.0,"16":664.0,"17":0.361445783,"18":0.822852301,"19":0.0,"20":94.0,"21":86.0,"22":0.0,"23":20.0,"24":5.0,"25":15.0,"26":13.0,"27":107.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":153.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.5400000000000003,"appliedStats":{"0":-15.5,"1":6.0,"3":2.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":1.5,"10":2.4000000000000004,"76":0.0,"12":0.8,"20":10.5,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-1.5},"appliedTotal":5.400000000000002,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":31.0,"1":6.0,"2":0.19354839,"3":1.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":1.0,"7":5.0,"8":7.0,"9":0.22580645,"10":3.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":35.0,"17":0.28571429,"18":0.51152074,"19":1.85294118,"20":7.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":5.0,"28":146.0,"29":4.17142857,"31":0.0,"67":8.0,"68":7.0,"69":1.0,"70":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":5.0,"75":5.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":10.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.6000000000000001,"appliedStats":{"0":-5.5,"1":2.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.6,"10":0.8,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"20":4.5,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":-0.6},"appliedTotal":1.8000000000000003,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":11.0,"1":2.0,"2":0.18181818,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":2.0,"8":2.0,"9":0.18181818,"10":1.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":12.0,"17":0.25,"18":0.43181818,"19":0.5,"20":3.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":2.0,"28":51.0,"29":4.25,"31":0.0,"67":5.0,"68":5.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":2.0,"75":1.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":3.0}},{"appliedAverage":1.9282608695652173,"appliedStats":{"0":-270.0,"1":144.0,"3":80.0,"4":15.0,"5":39.0,"7":25.8,"10":47.2,"76":0.0,"12":5.6000000000000005,"15":4.0,"20":108.0,"21":102.0,"23":15.0,"24":-3.0,"26":-4.800000000000001,"27":-41.699999999999996},"appliedTotal":266.09999999999997,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":540.0,"1":144.0,"2":0.26666667,"3":40.0,"4":5.0,"5":13.0,"6":58.0,"7":86.0,"8":233.0,"9":0.43148148,"10":59.0,"11":1.0,"12":7.0,"13":5.0,"14":3.0,"15":8.0,"16":614.0,"17":0.34369885,"18":0.77518034,"19":78.96327212,"20":72.0,"21":68.0,"22":6.0,"23":10.0,"24":3.0,"25":7.0,"26":6.0,"27":139.0,"28":2434.0,"29":3.96416938,"31":1.0,"67":193.0,"68":182.0,"69":9.0,"70":9.0,"71":0.98963731,"72":2.0,"73":3.0,"74":75.0,"75":62.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":138.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"totalRanking":165,"totalRating":266.09998},"1":{"positionalRanking":35,"totalRanking":702,"totalRating":1.7999998},"2":{"positionalRanking":36,"totalRanking":732,"totalRating":5.3999996},"3":{"positionalRanking":44,"totalRanking":808,"totalRating":9.300001}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransacti

big league career has followed a stepladder pattern through four years, but his ability to stay healthy enough to total career bests in starts (33) and innings (212 1/3) in 2018 was the most significant development of all. To the health point, Nola has enjoyed an uptick in velocity on all of his pitches in each of the past two seasons, averaging a career-high 93.5 mph with his four-seam fastball specifically. That's largely why he's so good at minimizing hard contact. And the fact that he was the only pitcher in baseball last season to post at least a 50 percent ground ball rate and 25 percent strikeout rate with no greater than a 7.5 percent walk rate shows how low-risk his skill set is. Nola did enjoy some good fortune on balls in play and stranding runners, so expect some regression in ERA/WHIP, but he's still one of the highest-floor pitchers available in any fantasy format. Maybe he doesn't feel like a building-block starter based on his age and experience level, but he's earned that status.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.2,"appliedStats":{"32":5.0,"33":-5.0,"34":41.5,"37":-14.5,"39":-8.0,"76":0.0,"45":-20.0,"46":-5.0,"48":35.0,"53":0.0,"54":-3.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":5.0},"appliedTotal":31.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":5.0,"33":5.0,"34":83.0,"35":125.0,"36":472.0,"37":29.0,"38":0.27884615,"39":16.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.62650602,"42":1.0,"43":0.368,"44":20.0,"45":20.0,"46":5.0,"47":6.5060241,"48":35.0,"49":11.38554217,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":1.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":5.0,"78":1.0,"79":3.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.1875}},{"appliedAverage":14.0,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":33.0,"33":-33.0,"34":315.0,"37":-86.5,"39":-29.5,"45":-68.0,"46":-21.0,"48":220.0,"53":15.0,"54":-8.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":125.0},"appliedTotal":462.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":33.0,"33":33.0,"34":630.0,"35":841.0,"36":0.0,"37":173.0,"38":0.22496749,"39":59.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.104761905,"42":6.0,"43":0.282996433,"44":73.0,"45":68.0,"46":21.0,"47":2.914285714,"48":220.0,"50":5.0,"51":1.0,"52":3.0,"53":15.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.652173913,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":25.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.728813559,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.0,"appliedStats":{"32":2.0,"33":-2.0,"34":16.0,"37":-7.0,"39":-3.0,"76":0.0,"45":-10.0,"46":-3.0,"48":13.0,"53":0.0,"54":-2.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":4.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":2.0,"33":2.0,"34":32.0,"35":52.0,"36":194.0,"37":14.0,"38":0.33333333,"39":6.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.875,"42":1.0,"43":0.40384615,"44":10.0,"45":10.0,"46":3.0,"47":8.4375,"48":13.0,"49":10.96875,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":2.0,"78":1.0,"79":2.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.16666667}},{"appliedAverage":6.0,"appliedStats":{"32":1.0,"33":-1.0,"34":8.5,"37":-2.5,"39":-2.0,"76":0.0,"45":-5.0,"46":-1.0,"48":9.0,"53":0.0,"54":-1.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":6.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":17.0,"35":27.0,"36":115.0,"37":5.0,"38":0.25,"39":4.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.58823529,"42":1.0,"43":0.37037037,"44":5.0,"45":5.0,"46":1.0,"47":7.94117647,"48":9.0,"49":14.29411765,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":1.0,"78":1.0,"79":1.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.25}},{"appliedAverage":11.867647058823529,"appliedStats":{"32":34.0,"33":-34.0,"34":303.5,"37":-88.0,"39":-40.0,"76":18.0,"45":-87.0,"46":-27.0,"48":229.0,"53":12.0,"54":-7.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":90.0},"appliedTotal":403.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":34.0,"33":34.0,"34":607.0,"35":852.0,"36":3332.0,"37":176.0,"38":0.23311258,"39":80.0,"40":3.0,"41":1.26523888,"42":11.0,"43":0.31338028,"44":91.0,"45":87.0,"46":27.0,"47":3.86985173,"48":229.0,"49":10.18616145,"50":3.0,"51":0.0,"52":2.0,"53":12.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.63157895,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":18.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":18.0,"77":16.0,"78":2.0,"79":4.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.8625}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":19,"totalRanking":42,"totalRating":403.5},"1":{"positionalRanking":122,"totalRanking":472,"totalRating":6.0},"2":{"positionalRanking":208,"totalRanking":780,"totalRating":4.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":108,"totalRanking":387,"totalRating":31.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":33837,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":33837,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture"

with one of the best sliders in the game -- 85 of his 182 strikeouts came with that pitch, and his 24.2 percent swinging-strike with it was seventh amongst 63 pitchers who threw 500 -- Flaherty was one of last season's most productive rookies in a season full of extraordinary rookie-class production. Remarkably, he wasn't a member of the St. Louis Cardinals' initial rotation, but after being summoned for good on May 15, he never missed a turn and posted a 2.81 ERA and 30.4 percent strikeout rate in his next 23 turns before seemingly fatiguing over his final three starts. Flaherty is now a locked-in member of the team's starting five, and though he might seemed primed for another step forward, keep in mind that he could use some work on his control -- 9.6 percent walk rate in the majors -- and perhaps stamina, having never pitched more than 182 2/3 innings in any of his five professional campaigns. He brings a lot of promise, certainly enough to be a top-25 fantasy starter in all formats, but there might be a hint of rate regression offset by an increase in (big league) workload.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":19.5,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":4.0,"12":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":6.0,"33":-6.0,"34":66.0,"37":-8.5,"39":-4.0,"45":-4.0,"46":-2.0,"48":53.0,"53":3.0,"54":-1.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":30.0},"appliedTotal":136.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":6.0,"33":6.0,"34":132.0,"35":153.0,"36":612.0,"37":17.0,"38":0.11805556,"39":8.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.56818182,"42":1.0,"43":0.16993464,"44":4.0,"45":4.0,"46":2.0,"47":0.81818182,"48":53.0,"49":10.84090909,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.75,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":6.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":1.0,"76":4.0,"77":2.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":1.0,"82":6.625}},{"appliedAverage":12.09375,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":-32.0,"34":274.5,"37":-74.5,"39":-35.0,"45":-68.0,"46":-22.0,"48":201.0,"53":13.0,"54":-7.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":105.0},"appliedTotal":387.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":32.0,"33":32.0,"34":549.0,"35":738.0,"36":0.0,"37":149.0,"38":0.224736048,"39":70.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.196721311,"42":10.0,"43":0.310298103,"44":73.0,"45":68.0,"46":22.0,"47":3.344262295,"48":201.0,"50":6.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":13.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.65,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":21.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":2.871428571,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":23.0,"appliedStats":{"32":3.0,"33":-3.0,"34":33.0,"37":-3.0,"39":-2.0,"76":2.0,"45":-1.0,"46":-1.0,"48":25.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":15.0},"appliedTotal":69.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":3.0,"33":3.0,"34":66.0,"35":74.0,"36":285.0,"37":6.0,"38":0.08571429,"39":4.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.45454545,"42":0.0,"43":0.13513514,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":0.40909091,"48":25.0,"49":10.22727273,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":3.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":6.25}},{"appliedAverage":23.5,"appliedStats":{"32":2.0,"33":-2.0,"34":21.0,"37":-1.5,"39":-1.5,"76":1.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":17.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":10.0},"appliedTotal":47.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":2.0,"33":2.0,"34":42.0,"35":46.0,"36":167.0,"37":3.0,"38":0.06976744,"39":3.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.42857143,"42":0.0,"43":0.13043478,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":17.0,"49":10.92857143,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":2.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":1.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":5.66666667}},{"appliedAverage":13.720588235294118,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":18.0,"12":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":33.0,"33":-33.0,"34":294.5,"37":-67.5,"39":-27.5,"45":-60.0,"46":-25.0,"48":231.0,"53":11.0,"54":-8.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":100.0},"appliedTotal":466.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":33.0,"33":33.0,"34":589.0,"35":772.0,"36":3179.0,"37":135.0,"38":0.19176136,"39":55.0,"40":2.0,"41":0.96774194,"42":7.0,"43":0.25518135,"44":62.0,"45":60.0,"46":25.0,"47":2.75042445,"48":231.0,"49":10.58913413,"50":6.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":11.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.57894737,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0

Simply put, Anderson's free-swinging ways make him wildly inconsistent, a batting average risk and a poor choice to bat atop any lineup, with the combination of those putting a cap on his stolen base potential. He's capable of a 20/30 season, with 15/20 numbers perhaps more realistic, but that's only a borderline top-100 player in Rotisserie leagues. Anderson is also one of the more overrated players using points-based scoring, having finished roughly 100 rankings spots lower in that format each of the past two seasons, making him only marginally draft-worthy in traditional mixed leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":2.670833333333333,"appliedStats":{"0":-52.0,"1":39.0,"3":16.0,"4":0.0,"5":12.0,"7":8.1,"10":4.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.5,"20":31.5,"21":13.5,"23":1.5,"24":-1.0,"26":-2.4000000000000004,"27":-6.6},"appliedTotal":64.1,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":104.0,"1":39.0,"2":0.375,"3":8.0,"4":0.0,"5":4.0,"6":12.0,"7":27.0,"8":59.0,"9":0.56730769,"10":5.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":110.0,"17":0.4,"18":0.96730769,"19":23.81651376,"20":21.0,"21":9.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.0,"26":3.0,"27":22.0,"28":381.0,"29":3.46363636,"31":0.0,"67":102.0,"68":30.0,"69":70.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.98039216,"72":2.0,"73":14.0,"74":10.0,"75":14.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":24.0}},{"appliedAverage":1.346979865771812,"appliedStats":{"0":-289.0,"1":144.0,"3":56.0,"4":12.0,"5":54.0,"7":28.2,"10":20.0,"76":0.0,"12":3.2,"15":1.5,"20":115.5,"21":87.0,"23":31.5,"24":-6.0,"26":-10.4,"27":-46.8,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"37":0.0,"39":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":200.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":578.0,"1":144.0,"2":0.249134948,"3":28.0,"4":4.0,"5":18.0,"6":50.0,"7":94.0,"8":234.0,"9":0.404844291,"10":25.0,"11":1.0,"12":4.0,"13":2.0,"14":5.0,"15":3.0,"16":612.0,"17":0.282679739,"18":0.687524029,"19":0.0,"20":77.0,"21":58.0,"22":0.0,"23":21.0,"24":6.0,"25":15.0,"26":13.0,"27":156.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":149.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.0454545454545454,"appliedStats":{"0":-22.5,"1":16.0,"3":2.0,"4":0.0,"5":6.0,"7":3.9,"10":2.4000000000000004,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.5,"20":12.0,"21":4.5,"23":1.5,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-3.0},"appliedTotal":22.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":45.0,"1":16.0,"2":0.35555556,"3":1.0,"4":0.0,"5":2.0,"6":3.0,"7":13.0,"8":23.0,"9":0.51111111,"10":3.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":49.0,"17":0.3877551,"18":0.89886621,"19":9.10416667,"20":8.0,"21":3.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":10.0,"28":168.0,"29":3.42857143,"31":0.0,"67":50.0,"68":15.0,"69":34.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.98,"72":1.0,"73":11.0,"74":6.0,"75":5.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":11.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.9400000000000001,"appliedStats":{"0":-8.0,"1":6.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":1.7999999999999998,"10":1.6,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"20":4.5,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":-1.2},"appliedTotal":4.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":16.0,"1":6.0,"2":0.375,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":6.0,"8":6.0,"9":0.375,"10":2.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":18.0,"17":0.44444444,"18":0.81944444,"19":2.66666667,"20":3.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":4.0,"28":67.0,"29":3.72222222,"31":0.0,"67":28.0,"68":8.0,"69":19.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.96428571,"72":1.0,"73":3.0,"74":3.0,"75":2.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":5.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.1967479674796753,"appliedStats":{"0":-249.0,"1":167.0,"3":64.0,"4":0.0,"5":54.0,"7":35.1,"10":12.0,"76":0.0,"12":2.4000000000000004,"15":1.0,"20":121.5,"21":84.0,"23":25.5,"24":-5.0,"26":-9.600000000000001,"27":-32.699999999999996},"appliedTotal":270.20000000000005,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":498.0,"1":167.0,"2":0.33534137,"3":32.0,"4":0.0,"5":18.0,"6":50.0,"7":117.0,"8":253.0,"9":0.50803213,"10":15.0,"11":0.0,"12":3.0,"13":2.0,"14":0.0,"15":2.0,"16":518.0,"17":0.35714286,"18":0.86517499,"19":89.7582846,"20":81.0,"21":56.0,"22":6.0,"23":17.0,"24":5.0,"25":12.0,"26":12.0,"27":109.0,"28":1765.0,"29":3.40733591,"31":1.0,"67":531.0,"68":182.0,"69":324.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.95291902,"72":25.0,"73":75.0,"74":56.0,"75":67.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":123.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":17,"totalRanking":158,"totalRating":270.19998},"1":{"positionalRanking":33,"totalRanking":554,"totalRating":4.7},"2":{"positionalRanking":16,"totalRanking":215,"totalRating":22.499998},"3":{"positionalRanking":8,"totalRanking":71,"totalRating":64.1}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"N

book on Bell as a prospect was a line-drive, gap hitter, so his 2017 power spike was considered somewhat questionable. The main reason was Bell's hard-hit and fly ball rates didn't portend such a lofty power surge, so the resultant 19.1 HR/FB mark was due to regress. Sure enough, last season, Bell maintained similar underlying power metrics, yet posted a 9.2 HR/FB. The only difference from the previous season was the switch-hitter pulled the ball more in 2017, but that doesn't explain the entire difference, if any. Bell's above-average plate skills drive a solid floor, especially in OBP and points leagues. After that, his fantasy potential will be defined by his ability to produce runs, which is obviously team-dependent. The Pirates finished in the lower half in scoring last season and probably will again, dampening Bell's run and RBI potential.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":1.9083333333333332,"appliedStats":{"0":-21.0,"1":11.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":9.0,"7":2.4,"10":5.6000000000000005,"76":0.0,"12":0.8,"20":6.0,"21":12.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-2.1},"appliedTotal":22.9,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":42.0,"1":11.0,"2":0.26190476,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":3.0,"6":3.0,"7":8.0,"8":20.0,"9":0.47619048,"10":7.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":50.0,"17":0.38,"18":0.85619048,"19":7.34693878,"20":4.0,"21":8.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":7.0,"28":207.0,"29":4.14,"31":0.0,"67":101.0,"68":90.0,"69":9.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.98019802,"72":2.0,"73":8.0,"74":7.0,"75":5.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":1.7168918918918916,"appliedStats":{"0":-252.5,"1":132.0,"3":56.0,"4":15.0,"5":45.0,"7":25.2,"10":56.800000000000004,"76":0.0,"12":2.4000000000000004,"15":0.0,"20":111.0,"21":106.5,"23":3.0,"24":-5.0,"26":-10.4,"27":-30.9,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"37":0.0,"39":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":254.09999999999997,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":505.0,"1":132.0,"2":0.261386139,"3":28.0,"4":5.0,"5":15.0,"6":48.0,"7":84.0,"8":215.0,"9":0.425742574,"10":71.0,"11":2.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":4.0,"15":0.0,"16":583.0,"17":0.353344768,"18":0.779087343,"19":0.0,"20":74.0,"21":71.0,"22":0.0,"23":2.0,"24":5.0,"25":-3.0,"26":13.0,"27":103.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":148.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":3.032867132867133,"appliedStats":{"0":-263.5,"1":146.0,"3":74.0,"4":9.0,"5":111.0,"7":20.7,"10":59.2,"76":0.0,"12":4.0,"15":3.5,"20":141.0,"21":174.0,"23":0.0,"24":-1.0,"26":-8.8,"27":-35.4},"appliedTotal":433.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":527.0,"1":146.0,"2":0.27703985,"3":37.0,"4":3.0,"5":37.0,"6":77.0,"7":69.0,"8":300.0,"9":0.56925996,"10":74.0,"11":13.0,"12":5.0,"13":7.0,"14":0.0,"15":7.0,"16":613.0,"17":0.36704731,"18":0.93630727,"19":109.81697171,"20":94.0,"21":116.0,"22":10.0,"23":0.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":11.0,"27":118.0,"28":2485.0,"29":4.05383361,"31":0.0,"67":1089.0,"68":981.0,"69":96.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.98898072,"72":12.0,"73":90.0,"74":65.0,"75":78.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":143.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":4,"totalRanking":27,"totalRating":433.7},"1":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0},"2":{"positionalRanking":0,"totalRanking":0,"totalRating":0.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":24,"totalRanking":537,"totalRating":22.9}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093335,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":15,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":29763,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":29763,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":14,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":2,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":293,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Pedro","fullName":"Pedro Strop","gamesPlayedByPosition":{"11":50},"id":29763,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Strop","lastNewsDate":1565927794000,"lastVideoDate":1561850666000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.0,"averageDraftPosition":0.0,"percentChange":-0.009207022812013577,"percentOwned":13.108499923699068,"percentStarted":10.712650694338471},"proTeamId":0,"seasonOutlook":"The Cubs leaned on Strop as the primary option to close out games after Brandon Morrow went on the shelf, and he finished with a career-high 13 saves in 2018 while posting a sub-3.00 ERA for the fifth straight season. Underneath the uptick in fantasy value, Strop posted his lowest strikeout rate since 2012 (23.8 percent), and hitters were able to put the ball in the air against him more frequently, snapping a four-year stretch in which he maintained a ground ball rate above 50 percent (46.1). Strop's ratios are at risk if he's unable to slow his declining strikeout rate. However, since Morrow is expected to miss at least the first month of the season, Strop is the favorite to open 2019 as the Cubs' closer and see plenty of save chances until Morrow is ready to return.

was a pleasant surprise in a disappointing season for the Mets. He worked primarily in a multi-inning relief role, throwing 101.1 innings despite starting just five times. He finished with an excellent 2.66 ERA and his first three career saves. The righty appears to be lined up for a similar role again this season, which should keep him fantasy-relevant if he can repeat similar numbers. Lugo's curveball was always intriguing due to its very high spin rate, but he'd been unable to translate that into a high strikeout rate in his first two big-league seasons. Last year, that number jumped up to 25.1%. Working in shorter stints helps a lot of pitchers, and there's reason to believe that Lugo's breakout is mostly sustainable, though even a modest step back could push him back toward the glob of mostly interchangeable middle relievers.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.681818181818182,"appliedStats":{"32":11.0,"33":0.0,"34":24.0,"37":-5.0,"39":0.0,"76":8.0,"45":-2.0,"46":-1.0,"48":22.0,"53":2.0,"54":-1.0,"57":3.0,"58":0.0,"60":1.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":62.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":11.0,"33":0.0,"34":48.0,"35":58.0,"36":237.0,"37":10.0,"38":0.1754386,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.625,"42":1.0,"43":0.18965517,"44":2.0,"45":2.0,"46":1.0,"47":1.125,"48":22.0,"49":12.375,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":2.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.66666667,"56":3.0,"57":3.0,"58":0.0,"59":1.0,"60":3.0,"61":1.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":8.0,"77":3.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity","83":6.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.304878048780488,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":41.0,"33":0.0,"34":129.0,"37":-34.5,"39":-12.5,"45":-27.0,"46":-9.0,"48":86.0,"53":4.0,"54":-6.0,"57":0.0,"58":-2.0,"60":7.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":176.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":41.0,"33":0.0,"34":258.0,"35":348.0,"36":0.0,"37":69.0,"38":0.219745223,"39":25.0,"40":4.0,"41":1.093023256,"42":2.0,"43":0.275862069,"44":30.0,"45":27.0,"46":9.0,"47":2.825581395,"48":86.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":4.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.4,"56":2.0,"57":0.0,"58":2.0,"59":0.0,"60":15.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.44,"83":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.5,"appliedStats":{"32":6.0,"33":0.0,"34":12.0,"37":-3.5,"39":0.0,"76":4.0,"45":-2.0,"46":-1.0,"48":10.0,"53":1.0,"54":-1.0,"57":1.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":27.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":6.0,"33":0.0,"34":24.0,"35":31.0,"36":133.0,"37":7.0,"38":0.23333333,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.875,"42":1.0,"43":0.25806452,"44":2.0,"45":2.0,"46":1.0,"47":2.25,"48":10.0,"49":11.25,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.5,"56":1.0,"57":1.0,"58":0.0,"59":1.0,"60":1.0,"61":1.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":4.0,"77":2.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity","83":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.25,"appliedStats":{"32":2.0,"33":0.0,"34":4.5,"37":-1.0,"39":0.0,"76":2.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":4.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":1.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":12.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":2.0,"33":0.0,"34":9.0,"35":12.0,"36":54.0,"37":2.0,"38":0.18181818,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.66666667,"42":1.0,"43":0.25,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":4.0,"49":12.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":1.0,"57":1.0,"58":0.0,"59":1.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity","83":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.434426229508197,"appliedStats":{"32":61.0,"33":0.0,"34":120.0,"37":-28.0,"39":-8.0,"76":39.0,"45":-24.0,"46":-8.0,"48":104.0,"53":7.0,"54":-4.0,"57":6.0,"58":-5.0,"60":10.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":270.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":61.0,"33":0.0,"34":240.0,"35":314.0,"36":1275.0,"37":56.0,"38":0.19243986,"39":16.0,"40":4.0,"41":0.9,"42":5.0,"43":0.24522293,"44":28.0,"45":24.0,"46":8.0,"47":2.7,"48":104.0,"49":11.7,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":7.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.63636364,"56":11.0,"57":6.0,"58":5.0,"59":0.54545455,"60":21.0,"61":3.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":39.0,"77":22.0,"78":1.0,"79":1.0,"80":0.0,"82":6.5,"83":27.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":11,"totalRanking":157,"totalRating":270.5},"1":{"positionalRanking":36,"totalRanking":174,"totalRating":12.5},"2":{"positionalRanking":20,"totalRanking":146,"totalRating":27.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":5,"totalRanking":76,"totalRating":62.5}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093336,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":39823,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":39823,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":18,"lineupLo

Bay has indicated they plan to deploy an opener in two rotation spots. With Blake Snell, Charlie Morton and Tyler Glasnow the likely three old-fashioned starters, Chirinos should be in the running to be the primary multi-inning reliever behind the openers. For fantasy, this isn't a bad thing, since that allows Chirinos to get a win tossing fewer than five stanzas. Chirinos relies on control with a ground ball tilt, though he possesses some projectable strikeout upside. His 11.3% swinging strike mark correlates to a mark about a whiff higher than last season's 7.5 K/9 level, especially since Tropicana Field boosts punchouts. Chirinos may not amass the innings of a typical starter, but he should throw significantly more than most relievers for those leagues designating starter and reliever roster spots. He's also fairly safe, as the Rays have a quick hook, and won't leave him in to take one for the team very often, if at all.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":1.6666666666666667,"appliedStats":{"32":3.0,"33":-1.0,"34":10.0,"37":-3.0,"39":0.0,"76":2.0,"45":-6.0,"46":-4.0,"48":4.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":5.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":3.0,"33":1.0,"34":20.0,"35":26.0,"36":84.0,"37":6.0,"38":0.23076923,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.9,"42":0.0,"43":0.23076923,"44":6.0,"45":6.0,"46":4.0,"47":8.1,"48":4.0,"49":5.4,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity"}},{"appliedAverage":7.211538461538462,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":26.0,"33":0.0,"34":201.0,"37":-66.5,"39":-16.0,"45":-57.0,"46":-15.0,"48":114.0,"53":8.0,"54":-7.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":187.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":26.0,"33":0.0,"34":402.0,"35":545.0,"36":0.0,"37":133.0,"38":0.264940239,"39":32.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.231343283,"42":4.0,"43":0.310091743,"44":62.0,"45":57.0,"46":15.0,"47":3.828358209,"48":114.0,"50":7.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":7.0,"55":0.533333333,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.5625,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":1.6666666666666667,"appliedStats":{"32":3.0,"33":-1.0,"34":10.0,"37":-3.0,"39":0.0,"76":2.0,"45":-6.0,"46":-4.0,"48":4.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":5.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":3.0,"33":1.0,"34":20.0,"35":26.0,"36":84.0,"37":6.0,"38":0.23076923,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.9,"42":0.0,"43":0.23076923,"44":6.0,"45":6.0,"46":4.0,"47":8.1,"48":4.0,"49":5.4,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity"}},{"appliedAverage":1.0,"appliedStats":{"32":2.0,"33":-1.0,"34":8.5,"37":-2.5,"39":0.0,"76":1.0,"45":-5.0,"46":-3.0,"48":2.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":2.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":2.0,"33":1.0,"34":17.0,"35":22.0,"36":68.0,"37":5.0,"38":0.22727273,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.88235294,"42":0.0,"43":0.22727273,"44":5.0,"45":5.0,"46":3.0,"47":7.94117647,"48":2.0,"49":3.17647059,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":1.0,"77":1.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":"Infinity"}},{"appliedAverage":9.26923076923077,"appliedStats":{"32":26.0,"33":-18.0,"34":200.0,"37":-56.0,"39":-14.0,"76":15.0,"45":-57.0,"46":-23.0,"48":114.0,"53":9.0,"54":-5.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":50.0},"appliedTotal":241.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":26.0,"33":18.0,"34":400.0,"35":530.0,"36":1985.0,"37":112.0,"38":0.2248996,"39":28.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.05,"42":3.0,"43":0.26981132,"44":61.0,"45":57.0,"46":23.0,"47":3.8475,"48":114.0,"49":7.695,"50":4.0,"51":3.0,"52":0.0,"53":9.0,"54":5.0,"55":0.64285714,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":10.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":15.0,"77":11.0,"78":1.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":4.07142857}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":30,"totalRanking":211,"totalRating":241.0},"1":{"positionalRanking":232,"totalRanking":685,"totalRating":2.0},"2":{"positionalRanking":247,"totalRanking":742,"totalRating":5.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":282,"totalRanking":895,"totalRating":5.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1552186093336,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":3,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":30765,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":30765,"keeperValue":1,"keeperValueFuture":21,"lineupLocked":true,"on

first glance, LeMahieu's average and OBP tumbled to four-year lows (.276 AVG, .321 OBP), and he took a step back offensively. But a closer look reveals that his approach shifted, as he hit more fly balls than ever before (29.5 percent) en route to a career-high 15 homers. At age 30, it's possible that LeMahieu is trying to maximize the overall value of his skillset, parlaying his ability to maintain a low strikeout rate and spray the ball to all fields with an added willingness to pull the ball in the air to do damage when appropriate. That will play well at Yankee Stadium, his new home park as a result of him signing a two-year deal with New York. LeMahieu's elite defensive skills should help him earn at-bats with his new club, but given the Yankees' depth, he may open the season in some sort of utility role. Leaving Colorado often drives down the price of hitters, and there are some concerns about playing time, but LeMahieu might be a sneaky player in the midst of a mid-career power surge, available on the cheap this draft season.

a per-inning basis, Doolittle was one of the most effective relievers in baseball last season, as he carried a 10.0 K/BB while posting career-best ERA (1.60) and WHIP (0.60) marks over 45 frames. Durability has been an issue for Doolittle, but fortunately, he did not miss time with shoulder trouble in 2018 after he required DL stints for strains and a torn rotator cuff from 2015-2017. He was able to return from a toe injury suffered in July before the end of the regular season. Despite losing a tick on his fastball, Doolittle generated more whiffs with the pitch last season, throwing it 88.5 percent of the time while mixing in the occasional slider or splitter. He'll open 2019 as the Nationals' closer and should remain in that role as long as he's healthy, but it would be foolish to expect much more than 50 innings from him, as he's only reached that number once in the past four seasons.

Coming off an absurd .306/.372/.751 hitting line with 31 home runs in 66 games following his July 2017 trade to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Martinez signed a five-year deal with the Boston Red Sox in late February, only to arguably improve his statistics in 2018. He boosted his contact rate by more than three full percentage points and his already-elite hard contact rate by nearly four percentage points, resulting in the fifth-best season using rotisserie scoring and 13th-best using points-based scoring. At 31, Martinez has a skill set that is among the most rock solid of any slugger, as he makes contact nearly three-quarters of the time, makes hard contact roughly 50 percent of the time he puts the ball in play, and possesses the most outstanding all-field power of anyone in baseball, with a league-leading (by an 11-homer margin) 38 home runs to the opposite field the past two seasons combined. He's also a heart-of-the-order hitter in one of the deepest lineups in baseball, meaning he's as good a Triple Crown contender as you'll find. This is a building-block, first-round player.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":1.8652173913043477,"appliedStats":{"0":-41.0,"1":20.0,"3":8.0,"4":0.0,"5":9.0,"7":3.9,"10":11.200000000000001,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.5,"20":16.5,"21":22.5,"23":1.5,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-8.4},"appliedTotal":42.9,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"0":82.0,"1":20.0,"2":0.24390244,"3":4.0,"4":0.0,"5":3.0,"6":7.0,"7":13.0,"8":33.0,"9":0.40243902,"10":14.0,"11":2.0,"12":0.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":97.0,"17":0.35051546,"18":0.75295449,"19":11.6875,"20":11.0,"21":15.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":28.0,"28":394.0,"29":4.06185567,"31":0.0,"67":10.0,"68":10.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":10.0,"75":13.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":23.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.1644295302013425,"appliedStats":{"0":-280.0,"1":181.0,"3":74.0,"4":6.0,"5":123.0,"7":30.299999999999997,"10":52.0,"76":0.0,"12":2.4000000000000004,"15":0.5,"20":154.5,"21":181.5,"23":7.5,"24":-1.0,"26":-15.200000000000001,"27":-45.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"37":0.0,"39":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"60":0.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":471.50000000000006,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":560.0,"1":181.0,"2":0.323214286,"3":37.0,"4":2.0,"5":41.0,"6":80.0,"7":101.0,"8":345.0,"9":0.616071429,"10":65.0,"11":9.0,"12":3.0,"13":6.0,"14":7.0,"15":1.0,"16":635.0,"17":0.392125984,"18":1.008197413,"19":0.0,"20":103.0,"21":121.0,"22":0.0,"23":5.0,"24":1.0,"25":4.0,"26":19.0,"27":150.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":0.0,"33":0.0,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.0,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.0,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.0,"44":0.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":0.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":149.0,"82":0.0,"83":0.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.4099999999999997,"appliedStats":{"0":-18.5,"1":12.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":3.0,"7":3.3,"10":4.800000000000001,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.5,"20":9.0,"21":13.5,"23":1.5,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-4.2},"appliedTotal":24.099999999999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":37.0,"1":12.0,"2":0.32432432,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":11.0,"8":15.0,"9":0.40540541,"10":6.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":44.0,"17":0.40909091,"18":0.81449631,"19":6.27906977,"20":6.0,"21":9.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":14.0,"28":194.0,"29":4.40909091,"31":0.0,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":5.0,"75":5.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":10.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.683333333333333,"appliedStats":{"0":-12.5,"1":9.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":3.0,"7":2.4,"10":2.4000000000000004,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"20":4.5,"21":9.0,"23":1.5,"24":0.0,"26":-0.8,"27":-2.4},"appliedTotal":16.099999999999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":25.0,"1":9.0,"2":0.36,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":8.0,"8":12.0,"9":0.48,"10":3.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":28.0,"17":0.42857143,"18":0.90857143,"19":5.14285714,"20":3.0,"21":6.0,"22":0.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":8.0,"28":117.0,"29":4.17857143,"31":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":3.0,"75":3.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":6.0}},{"appliedAverage":2.828082191780822,"appliedStats":{"0":-287.5,"1":175.0,"3":66.0,"4":6.0,"5":108.0,"7":31.2,"10":57.6,"76":0.0,"12":3.2,"15":2.5,"20":147.0,"21":157.5,"23":3.0,"24":0.0,"26":-15.200000000000001,"27":-41.4},"appliedTotal":412.90000000000003,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":575.0,"1":175.0,"2":0.30434783,"3":33.0,"4":2.0,"5":36.0,"6":71.0,"7":104.0,"8":320.0,"9":0.55652174,"10":72.0,"11":9.0,"12":4.0,"13":5.0,"14":0.0,"15":5.0,"16":657.0,"17":0.38262195,"18":0.93914369,"19":122.16383308,"20":98.0,"21":105.0,"22":7.0,"23":2.0,"24":0.0,"25":2.0,"26":19.0,"27":138.0,"28":2497.0,"29":3.80640244,"31":0.0,"67":74.0,"68":67.0,"69":4.0,"70":3.0,"71":0.95945946,"72":3.0,"73":1.0,"74":76.0,"75":69.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":146.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":4,"totalRanking":38,"totalRating":412.90002},"1":{"positionalRanking":11,"totalRanking":101,"totalRating":16.1},"2":{"positionalRanking":20,"totalRanking":192,"totalRating":24.099998},"3":{"positionalRanking":19,"totalRanking":217,"totalRating":42.9}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1559648810460,"acquisi

off a winter that saw the Boston Red Sox practically ignore their bullpen, Barnes might be their de facto closer at the onset of spring training.

Barnes' control is the shakiest part of his game, as he walked 11.7 percent of the hitters he faced in 2018, and it threatens to make him an inconsistent choice for save chances.

though.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":3.730769230769231,"appliedStats":{"32":13.0,"33":0.0,"34":18.5,"37":-4.5,"39":-5.0,"76":8.0,"45":-2.0,"46":-1.0,"48":19.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":-1.0,"60":2.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":48.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"032019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":13.0,"33":0.0,"34":37.0,"35":56.0,"36":236.0,"37":9.0,"38":0.19565217,"39":10.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.54054054,"42":0.0,"43":0.33928571,"44":3.0,"45":2.0,"46":1.0,"47":1.45945946,"48":19.0,"49":13.86486486,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":1.0,"54":0.0,"55":1.0,"56":1.0,"57":0.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.0,"60":5.0,"61":1.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":8.0,"77":5.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":1.9,"83":5.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.338709677419355,"appliedStats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"7":0.0,"10":0.0,"76":0.0,"12":0.0,"15":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"32":62.0,"33":0.0,"34":94.5,"37":-25.0,"39":-15.0,"45":-24.0,"46":-6.0,"48":90.0,"53":3.0,"54":-4.0,"57":33.0,"58":-5.0,"60":3.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":207.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.0,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.0,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.0,"30":0.0,"31":0.0,"32":62.0,"33":0.0,"34":189.0,"35":267.0,"36":0.0,"37":50.0,"38":0.214592275,"39":30.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.26984127,"42":2.0,"43":0.307116105,"44":25.0,"45":24.0,"46":6.0,"47":3.428571428,"48":90.0,"50":8.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.428571429,"56":38.0,"57":33.0,"58":5.0,"59":0.868421053,"60":7.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"65":0.0,"66":0.0,"67":0.0,"68":0.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"81":0.0,"82":3.0,"83":40.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.0,"appliedStats":{"32":7.0,"33":0.0,"34":9.5,"37":-2.0,"39":-3.0,"76":5.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":11.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":-1.0,"60":1.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":28.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"022019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":7.0,"33":0.0,"34":19.0,"35":29.0,"36":129.0,"37":4.0,"38":0.17391304,"39":6.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.57894737,"42":0.0,"43":0.34482759,"44":1.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":11.0,"49":15.63157895,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":1.0,"57":0.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.0,"60":3.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":5.0,"77":2.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":1.83333333,"83":3.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.25,"appliedStats":{"32":2.0,"33":0.0,"34":3.0,"37":-1.0,"39":-1.0,"76":2.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"48":4.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":-1.0,"60":0.5,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":8.5,"externalId":"2019","id":"012019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":2.0,"33":0.0,"34":6.0,"35":11.0,"36":54.0,"37":2.0,"38":0.22222222,"39":2.0,"40":0.0,"41":2.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.36363636,"44":1.0,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.0,"48":4.0,"49":18.0,"50":0.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":0.0,"54":0.0,"55":0.0,"56":1.0,"57":0.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.0,"60":1.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":2.0,"77":0.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.0,"83":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.6285714285714286,"appliedStats":{"32":70.0,"33":0.0,"34":96.5,"37":-25.5,"39":-19.0,"76":47.0,"45":-27.0,"46":-8.0,"48":110.0,"53":5.0,"54":-4.0,"57":4.0,"58":-8.0,"60":13.0,"63":0.0},"appliedTotal":254.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":70.0,"33":0.0,"34":193.0,"35":285.0,"36":1310.0,"37":51.0,"38":0.20987654,"39":38.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.38341969,"42":2.0,"43":0.31929825,"44":29.0,"45":27.0,"46":8.0,"47":3.77720207,"48":110.0,"49":15.38860104,"50":13.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":5.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.55555556,"56":12.0,"57":4.0,"58":8.0,"59":0.33333333,"60":26.0,"61":7.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":47.0,"77":23.0,"78":1.0,"79":0.0,"80":1.0,"82":2.89473684,"83":30.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":23,"totalRanking":185,"totalRating":254.0},"1":{"positionalRanking":110,"totalRanking":335,"totalRating":8.5},"2":{"positionalRanking":15,"totalRanking":130,"totalRating":28.0},"3":{"positionalRanking":24,"totalRanking":156,"totalRating":48.5}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1562124703616,"acquisitionType":"TRADE","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":0,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":32797,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":0.0,"id":32797,"

being acquired by Arizona as one of the centerpieces of the Paul Goldschmidt trade, Kelly should eventually take over as the Diamondbacks' primary backstop, perhaps even this season. However, with veterans Alex Avila and John Ryan Murphy hanging around, Kelly likely won't play enough to be relevant in mixed leagues, especially if he doesn't improve the quality of his contact. Bat meets ball frequently enough (14 percent minor league strikeout rate), it just bounces off with a weak exit velocity, capping his average and power. Among position players with at least 30 batted-ball events last season, Kelly's average exit velocity was the 11th lowest. Still just 24 years old, Kelly has plenty of time to take advantage of his advanced plate skills. However, he doesn't appear to be in line to play enough to be a fantasy factor in anything but the deepest of leagues, with a slight bump in points formats rewarding walks while penalizing punch

suffered a serious shoulder injury doing what he does best, going all out for a catch, just before the All-Star Break. He was supposed to miss 4-6 weeks, but was back in the lineup in just 19 days. Normally, a hitter's numbers taper off after returning from an injury, but Pillar's numbers were mostly the same both before and after. Pillar will be in the lineup every day when healthy because of his outstanding defense. That extra playing time allows him to compile production across the board, but he does so from the bottom of the lineup because he is trending into Alcides Escobar territory in OBP. Pillar's OBP declined each of the past four seasons, and his strikeout rate has climbed. There could be a little more here in 2019 with more games, but not very

final 2018 stats gave him a more trustworthy look than is the truth, despite the fact that he's projected to begin 2019 as Brad Hand's primary setup man. While Cimber had a 5.1 K-to-walk ratio to begin the season with the San Diego Padres, that number dropped to 1.0 following his trade to the Cleveland Indians, and his mediocre velocity gives him the look of more of a pitch-to-contact, matchups-driven pitcher than a top holds (or even saves) candidate.

has transitioned nicely to a part-time role in the waning years of his career, but last year's efforts were disrupted by a torn Achilles tendon that ended his season after 40 games.
